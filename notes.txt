Commanding:




what the hell is the difference between the xaml and the xaml.cs files?
answer:

the xaml files are the files that contain markup language which is used to 
define the user interface that the public uses to interact
with the application.


the xaml.cs files is the code-behind of said xaml files. These files
contain C# code that handles events, logic of said application, and manipulates 
the ui elements in the xaml files.



What is MVVM?
this is an software architectural pattern or like a conceptual framework that
helps the coder understand how to a ui application from the ground-up. There are three
components of MVVM:

-models
-views
-view models

What in the world is a view and a view model?

-the view represents the user interface (UI) of the application. Typically this is responsible
for presenting data to the user and capturing input from the user. 
views are typically implemented with some sort of markup language and usually have
minimal code-behind logic (it primarily focuses on ui)

view model 
-this is the middle man between the model and the view. it presents the operations and data from
the model to the view. 


What is BindingContexts and/or binding and why is it important?

binding
-binding is the process of connecting properties of a view (ui shit)
to properties of a viewModel. this process allows data to flow effortlessly
between the view and the viewModel. 
-when bound properties in the viewModel change then the corresponding UI elements in the
view will automatically update to reflect said changes, and vice versa.
