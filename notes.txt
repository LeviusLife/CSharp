Commanding:




what the hell is the difference between the xaml and the xaml.cs files?
answer:

the xaml files are the files that contain markup language which is used to 
define the user interface that the public uses to interact
with the application.


the xaml.cs files is the code-behind of said xaml files. These files
contain C# code that handles events, logic of said application, and manipulates 
the ui elements in the xaml files.
